# JavaScript Basics

## Introduction
This repository is organized into two main folders, each focusing on different aspects of JavaScript.
## folder1: JavaScript Basics
This folder contains examples and explanations of fundamental JavaScript concepts. Topics covered include printing statements, variables and data types, operators, conditional statements, alerts and prompts, loops, and template literals. These resources are designed to help beginners get started with JavaScript and grasp the essential building blocks of the language.

## folder2: Advanced JavaScript Demonstrations
This folder showcases several advanced JavaScript programming concepts and functionalities. The primary focus is on generating usernames and demonstrating various string, object, and array manipulations, as well as different function types and higher-order array methods (`map`, `filter`, `reduce`). The examples in this folder aim to provide a deeper understanding of JavaScript and illustrate how to implement more complex functionalities in your code.

## Printing Statements
In JavaScript, you can print statements to the console using the `console.log()` function. This is useful for debugging and understanding the flow of your code.

## Variables and Data Types
Variables are used to store data values. JavaScript supports various data types including:

- **String**: Textual data enclosed in quotes.
- **Number**: Numeric values.
- **Boolean**: True or false values.
- **Object**: Collections of key-value pairs.
- **Array**: Ordered lists of values.
- **Null**: Represents the intentional absence of any object value.
- **Undefined**: Indicates that a variable has not been assigned a value.

## Operators

### Assignment Operator
The assignment operator (`=`) is used to assign values to variables.

### Comparison Operators
Comparison operators are used to compare two values.

- `==`: Equal to
- `===`: Strict equal to
- `!=`: Not equal to
- `!==`: Strict not equal to
- `>`: Greater than
- `<`: Less than
- `>=`: Greater than or equal to
- `<=`: Less than or equal to

### Logical Operators
Logical operators are used to combine conditional statements.

- `&&`: Logical AND
- `||`: Logical OR
- `!`: Logical NOT

### Ternary Operator
The ternary operator is a shorthand for the `if-else` statement. It evaluates a condition and returns one value if true and another if false.

## Conditional Statements
Conditional statements are used to perform different actions based on different conditions. The main conditional statements in JavaScript are `if`, `else if`, and `else`.

## Alerts and Prompts
- **Alert**: Displays a message to the user.
- **Prompt**: Asks the user for input and stores the response.

## Loops
Loops are used to repeat a block of code multiple times. JavaScript supports several types of loops:

- **For Loop**: Repeats a block of code a specified number of times.
- **For-Of Loop**: Iterates over iterable objects like arrays and strings.
- **For-In Loop**: Iterates over the properties of an object.

## Template Literals
Template literals allow for embedded expressions and multi-line strings using backticks (`` ` ``). They also support string interpolation, making it easier to create strings with embedded variables.

# Username Generator and Various JavaScript Demonstrations

### Username Generation:
- Prompts the user to input their name without spaces.
- Generates four potential usernames by appending a random number to the name.
- Allows the user to select one of the generated usernames.

## String Operations:
- Demonstrates string properties and methods such as:
  - Length
  - Indexing
  - Conversion to upper and lower case
  - Trimming
  - Slicing
  - Concatenation
  - Character access

## Object Creation and Template Literals:
- Defines an object representing a product with properties like:
  - Name
  - Color
  - Rating
  - Price
  - Discount
  - Deal status
- Uses template literals to create formatted strings incorporating object properties.

## Array Manipulations:
- Illustrates array creation, updating elements, checking types, and various array methods including:
  - Pushing
  - Popping
  - Unshifting
  - Shifting
  - Splicing
- Includes examples of iterating over arrays using `for...in` and `forEach` loops.

## Functions:
- Demonstrates the use of regular functions for logging messages and performing arithmetic operations.
- Shows how to define and use arrow functions for mathematical computations.

## Higher-Order Array Methods:
- Utilizes `map` to transform array elements.
- Applies `filter` to select elements based on a condition.
- Employs `reduce` to aggregate array values into a single result.


## Conclusion
This guide covers the essential concepts of JavaScript for beginners . Hope it helps you.
